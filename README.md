# EstateAgentCompany

College project (Internet Applications Development module):

 I designed and developed a database-driven website for a company that advertises real estate for sale.
 
 This step involved using HTML, CSS and PHP to develop the database-driven, e-business website. 
 The application has as a main feature the following functionality:
 
• dynamically generated property
• dynamically generated testimonials page
• retrieve data from multiple tables
• login for administrator to control access to certain parts of the site(manage testimonial/properties/vendors/enquiries)
• functionality for administrator to view/edit/delete database entries such as
properties/testimonials/vendors
